# RayCasting - 2D
This is a program that simulates and determines shadows and light. <br>
Such techniques were used in the very first ego-shooter games with Doom or Wolfenstein being one of them. <br>
It is possible to extend this program to a 2D-calculated 3D-Simulation (I know, sounds weird) by giving each "pixel column" an appropriate color and size. This is what you would typically think of as "raycasting".<br>
